# Block Break Canvas JS

This project been made in order to learn more about canvas and pratice some JS.

In the project directory you can run to install: 

```bash
$ yarn

or 

$ npm i
```
 
 Then you can do to run your project on port 1234 using parcel:

 ```bash
 $ yarn start
 
or

 $ npm run start
 ```

 I followed this tutorial video __[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EMxBkqC4z0&t=1562s)__ to learn how to handle the canvas, and I made some changes in the assets and general aspects of the game, and reorganized some code, making more classes to split the code a bit more... Still have some work to be as I would like, but that is ok for now.
